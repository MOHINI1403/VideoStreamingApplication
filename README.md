# Video Streaming Application

A full-featured video streaming platform built on Node.js and Express.js, offering an interactive, personalized user experience with real-time analytics, secure user management, and dynamic media content handling. Deployed on Azure App Services, this application employs a CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions for smooth, scalable deployment.

## Key Features

- **Secure User Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with separate access and refresh tokens, stored securely in the user model, ensures safe and reliable user access.
- **User Profile and History Management**: MongoDB tracks user profiles, watch history, and subscription details, allowing seamless video consumption and personalized interaction tracking.
- **Channel Subscription System**: Users can subscribe or unsubscribe to channels, view the list of their subscriptions, and check a channelâ€™s subscriber details.
- **Cloud-Based Media Management**: Cloudinary integration enables users to easily upload and update profile avatars and channel cover images.
- **Efficient Data Management**: MongoDB aggregation pipelines power advanced features, supporting efficient handling of user watch history and subscriptions.
- **Robust Error Handling and Validation**: Comprehensive error handling ensures a smooth user experience with clear error messaging and input validation.
- **CI/CD Pipeline for Scalable Deployment**: GitHub Actions streamline the CI/CD pipeline, enhancing deployment efficiency and scalability.
- **Real-Time Analytics and Health Monitoring**: Real-time analytics and a health-check API maintain platform stability and responsiveness.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (with Aggregation Pipelines)
- **Authentication**: JWT for access and refresh tokens, bcrypt for secure password hashing
- **Media Management**: Cloudinary for avatar and cover image storage
